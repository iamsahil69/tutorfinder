# Tutorfinder

TutorFinder is a project created using HTML, CSS ,Javascript ,PHP and Mysql. The main motive behind this project is to help students to find suitable teacher or tutor in their locality whether it will be hometutor or classroom tutor and to help teachers to find students to teach. 

In this project Tutor can come and signup for an account in which he/she will provide his/her information relating to his/her qualification, teaching experience ,expertise in subject and contact information. All this information will act as his/her profile. and will be stored in a 
database and will be retrieved when required. This profile information will be shown to students whose requirements will match with this profile.

Students can do two things by using this project. Firstly they can find tutor related to their interest of study in their locality & can decide which tutor to study from this can be decided based on various factors like locality, qualification and reviews etc about the tutor.

Secondly, they can review a teacher based upon their experience with the concerned tutor.In this review they can give star ratings to the tutor and can give a comment as a feedback which will be very helpful for more students while considering that tutor.This review will also be
useful for tutors as well. As they can improve their teaching by using these valuable feedback from students.
